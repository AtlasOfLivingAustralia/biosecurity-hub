            Australia is one of the most biodiverse continents on our planet,
            but the health of our native flora, fauna and environment is under
            constant threat from introduced and invasive species. Introduced
            species include agricultural, horticultural and forestry plants and
            crops, and domestic animals, however many of these species have been
            introduced into regions outside their native range and have become
            problematic. The impact of invasive species now threatens commercial
            sectors, Indigenous people’s connection to Country and Australia’s
            native biodiversity.

              The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) aggregates species occurrence
              records within Australia, be they native or introduced species.

              As of 2020, the ALA held 2,383 introduced species and over 1.9
              million occurrences of pests, weeds and agricultural diseases.
            </p>
            <p class="hub-intro__content-text">
              Furthermore, through automated aggregation of data from over 850
              data partners, the ALA is an essential resource for biosecurity
              detection, and is often the first platform where new biosecurity
              incursions are detected.
            </p>
            <p class="hub-intro__content-text">
              To aid the research and management of introduced and invasive
              species, the ALA has been developing and collaborating on several
              biosecurity initiatives.

                  For over a decade the ALA has been receiving reports of
                  species of biosecurity concern, but until recently there has
                  been no systematic mechanism for notifying relevant
                  biosecurity authorities. The ALA has now developed a
                  biosecurity alert system, which notifies government partners
                  of occurrences of invasive species of environment, animal, or
                  plant health concern. This system was developed in close
                  collaboration the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and
                  Forestry (DAFF). Through CSIRO Mission investment, the ALA is
                  now able to expand our alert system to other jurisdictions. We
                  are actively looking for government organisations that manage
                  biosecurity at both Commonwealth and State/Territory levels to
                  join.

                  The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) is Australia’s largest
                  open-source biodiversity data infrastructure with hundreds of
                  data providers. As such, the ALA is often the first platform
                  where new species incursions are recorded; including through
                  the fastest growing source of data for the ALA- citizen
                  science. The ALA recognises the importance of community
                  surveillance as an important early warning system for new
                  biosecurity incursions and also helping to improve
                  understanding of the spread of invasive species. The ALA is
                  working to assist the community through the development of
                  projects and tools that enhance the ability of our community
                  to identify species of biosecurity concern. Currently, the ALA
                  is helping to advise the Invasive Species Council on the
                  development of citizen science projects targeting invasive
                  species of concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are also continually looking for ways to enhance the
                  identification of introduced and invasive species through the
                  various biodiversity data providers we receive data from.

                  Introduced and invasive species now make up a significant
                  proportion of all species recorded in Australia, but until
                  recently the data to show this has been elusive. To tackle
                  this challenge, the ALA is collaborating with government
                  departments, NGOs and industry partners to increase the
                  aggregation of pests, weeds and diseases data into the ALA.
                  Through this work the ALA will be able to more accurately
                  represent the true prevalence of introduced species in our
                  environment and enhance the value of the ALA for the
                  biosecurity sector nationally.

                  The ALA aggregates data from a multitude of sources and is a

                  Sensitive species data form a central component of biosecurity
                  legislation (Biosecurity Act 2015) aimed at managing risk to
                  human health, trade, agriculture, and the environment from the
                  introduction of exotic species, viruses and pathogens. The
                  sensitivity of these species data, however, has led to
                  invasive species occurrence databases not being publicly
                  available or not being aggregated in one place, which has
                  limited its use for surveillance and management. To tackle the
                  challenges of sharing sensitive species data, the ALA in
                  collaboration with governments around Australia is developing
                  a national standard and data-sharing service, which will
                  enable jurisdictions to obscure and share data, and to provide
                  a controlled access point for licenced third-party users.

                  Biological control (‘biocontrol’) involves the introduction of
                  insects, mites and/or pathogens of a target weed to reduce the
                  weed density to a level at which it can be maintained. It is
                  an economical, self-sustaining and environmentally friendly
                  management technique. The ALA hosts the Australian Biocontrol
                  Hub, which is used for the monitoring of biocontrol agent
                  releases and the capturing of biocontrol agent spread,
                  providing easy access to information on biocontrol agent
                  diagnostics, management practices and references. There are

                <p>
                  Although the speed of the generation of genomics data is
                  increasing rapidly, these data themselves are currently
                  located in disparate and disconnected repositories, making the
                  task of searching long and difficult. Australian Research
                  Genome Atlas will create a single, flexible index to assist
                  researchers and government agencies to co-locate all genomics
                  data for a given taxon (both native and introduced) in a
                  single search.

                <p>
                  One of the challenges facing the biosecurity sector is limited
                  access to modelling resources, expertise and silos between
                  organisations and jurisdictions that impede best practice.
                  Consequently, models are often developed for a single purpose
                  and are rarely shared or reused. The ALA is a partner in
                  developing the Biosecurity Commons – a cloud-based decision
                  support platform for modelling and analysing biosecurity risk
                  and response. The platform will address the limitations of
                  Australia’s biosecurity modelling capability by offering
                  researchers and decision-makers a suite of tools and resources
                  to investigate biosecurity questions. Biosecurity Commons is
                  built upon the architecture, infrastructure, and expertise of

                <p>
                  Current weed identification relies on expert knowledge,
                  interpreting taxonomic or morphological identification keys,
                  trying to match a weed with an image in a weed guide or app,
                  or sending a weed image or specimen to herbariums for
                  identification. This often leads to delayed or incorrect
                  identification that impedes timely action, particularly on
                  emerging weeds that threaten biosecurity. The ALA is a partner
                  in developing WeedScan – an artificial-intelligence-based
                  diagnostics and information tool for the rapid identification
                  and management of weeds in Australia. The tool will be
                  available through a website and smartphone app, and is due to
                  be publicly launched in mid-2023.

                <p>
                  CSIRO and DAFF have embarked on a joint biosecurity research,
                  development, and innovation work program – known as Catalysing
                  Australia’s Biosecurity (CAB). This program, running until
                  2030 and aligned with the Commonwealth Biosecurity 2030
                  strategy, will tackle challenges across the biosecurity
                  sector, including detection and diagnostics platforms,
                  taxonomy issues, novel treatments and connecting data systems.
                  The ALA is an active partner in several CAB initiatives and
                  more detail about outcomes from this initiative will be
                  available soon.

                  Most biosecurity threats to Australia come from introduced
                  species, and the ALA is uniquely situated to assist with
                  identifying these through its membership in the Global
                  Biodiversity Information facility (GBIF). As the Australian
                  node for GBIF, the ALA has rea- time access to exotic species
                  data and distributions. The ALA is also involved in several of
                  GBIF’s biosecurity initiatives, such as partnering to develop
                  a simple methodology for drawing up a 'watch list' that
                  countries can use to identify foreign species most likely to
                  pose a substantial threat of invasion to native biodiversity.
